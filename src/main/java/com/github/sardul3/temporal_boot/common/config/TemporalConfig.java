/**
 * TemporalConfig is a Spring Boot configuration class responsible for setting up the
 * Temporal components needed for interacting with Temporal workflows and activities.
 *
 * This configuration defines:
 * - A `WorkflowClient` bean to connect to the Temporal service.
 * - A `WorkerFactory` bean to manage and create workers.
 * - A `Worker` bean that registers workflows and activities to handle tasks in the `ScheduledPaymentQueue`.
 *
 * This configuration enables the application to poll for workflow and activity tasks
 * and execute them based on the registered implementations.
 *
 * <p><b>Author's Intent:</b></p>
 * The intent of this configuration is to seamlessly integrate Temporal into a Spring Boot
 * application. It allows for easy management of workflows and activities by leveraging
 * Spring's dependency injection and Temporal's worker-based task execution.
 *
 * This setup abstracts away the complexity of managing Temporal workers and makes it
 * easier to work with Temporal in a Spring Boot environment by registering the necessary
 * beans for workflow execution and activity handling.
